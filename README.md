HELLO ALL,

  THIS IS PRETTY MUCH MY FIRST PYTHON PROJECT THAT I HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO MAKE PUBLIC. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PRETTY MUCH HONE MY CURRENT PYTHON SKILL.
  IT'S STILL A WOP BUT EXPECT IT TO HAVE SOME CHANGES AND ADDITIONS BASED OFF OF WHAT I KNOW NOW AND WHAT I WILL LATER. THANK YOU!
